My vim config. Some of the autocommand goodies and basics came from a .vimrc which was passed around cs.pdx.edu, I
can't remember who it originally came from. The submodules in the bundle dir are loaded with tpope's [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

My current favorite colorscheme is [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim), though sometimes I favor [inkpot](https://github.com/ciaranm/inkpot). Both are included.

The [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) setup benefits from use of the [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) font with special characters. Good luck if you're using xterm,
I actually switched to terminator just for the joy of the silly arrows.

There's also [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) for nice filetree browsing, and the excellent addon [vim-nerdtree-tabs](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs) which keeps the tree consistent across multiple tabs.

I've got more from tpope, specifically [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), which replaced some of my own hacky attempts at vimscript with similar functionality, and [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) which makes text editing simply better, it should really just be part of vim's main-line codebase.

[vim-signify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify) is also wonderful, one of those things you don't know you need until you have it and then can't live without.
