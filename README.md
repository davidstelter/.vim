My vim config. Some of the autocommand goodies and basics came from a .vimrc which was passed around cs.pdx.edu, I
can't remember who it originally came from. The submodules in the bundle dir are loaded with pathogen.

My current favorite colorscheme is jellybeans, though sometimes I favor inkpot. Both are included.

The airline setup benefits from use of the powerline font with special characters. Good luck if you're using xterm,
I actually switched to terminator just for the joy of the silly arrows.
